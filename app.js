/**
 * Leetcode: 167. Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted

Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted
in non-decreasing order, 
find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. 
Let these two numbers be 
numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.

Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, 
added by one as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.

The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution.
You may not use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.

/**
 * Example 1:

Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. 
Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].

/**
 * LEETCODE: 125. Valid Palindrome

A phrase is a palindrome if, 
after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters 
and removing all non-alphanumeric characters,
it reads the same forward and backward. 
Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.

/**
 * Example 1:

Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.
